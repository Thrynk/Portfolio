{{< figure src="/images/CV.jpg" title="CARIN Thomas" >}}

Passionate about Data Science and Computer Science, I'm Thomas, dedicated to exploring these realms since 2017, with a keen interest that sparked at the age of 14.

Driven by a love for learning and an insatiable curiosity, I leave nothing to chance in my quest for knowledge. Engaging in personal projects within my field, I delved even deeper into Data Science at the end of 2021.

The profound insights we can extract from data fascinate me, and I firmly believe that the current revolution revolves around Data. I am eager to contribute to it. 

Coming from a Computer Science background, my affinity for Mathematics finds its perfect synergy in this field.

Convinced that I can bring value to your company, I would be delighted to discuss further. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-carin-843691151/) or via email : **thocarin@gmail.com**

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am also passionate about sports, currently engaged in climbing, and boasting a seven-year history of playing tennis.
