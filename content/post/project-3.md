---

In this school project, we have to program an AI playing the game Dots and Boxes.
Our AI will be evaluated in a tournament where all the AI of the class are attending.

I'm currently programming a handmade algorithm, and after that I will train a Reinforcement Learning AI against my algorithm.

There is not much content now, because I just started the project. But I will update this project page during the project, so stay in touch !
